* TODO Fragile activation

Instead of transient activation, create a fragile activation for prefixes that uses read-char on the target mode map only once.

* TODO Create special modes and maps

 - For when the region is active.
 - For when numeric argument is non-nil.

* TODO Generalize scopes

The implicit assumption that scopes only apply to text objects is
limited.

* TODO Support repeated insertion?

Vim can do COUNT i {type something} ESC.
